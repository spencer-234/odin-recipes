            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol style="font-size: 130%;">
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes<br>
                    or until al dente; drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant<br>
                    and softened, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly.</li>
                <li>
                    Stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when<br>
                    pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce and<br>
                    cook just until the sauce begins to simmer.
                </li>
                <li>Ladle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.</li>
